                    <p class="other-text"> I’ve spent my entire life as a game designer and the greater part of my life as a programmer. I’ve spent so long with both in my life, in fact, that I’ve been calling myself a game designer since long before I realized I’m trans and genderfluid. Now, I’m as much a part of the LGBTQIA+ community as I am a game designer and D&D dungeon master. I also make and sell handmade resin dice, and I develop and moderate for the web browser game <a href="https://mafia.gg/" target="_blank">Mafia.gg</a></p>

            <div class="row mt-4">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p class="other-text"> I’ve been a game designer since I was in first grade. My parents love to tell the story about how I came home from school one day with a board game I’d made in class, and how it changed my life forever. I was so excited to have them play it that they simply couldn’t say no, and so in short order we were playing <i>Gingerbread Escape</i>, a game about a freshly-baked gingerbread man trying to make his escape out of the kitchen without being caught by the dog. It was a simple game, with elements from both <i>Snakes and Ladders</i> as well as <i>Candyland</i> (two of my favourite games at the time), and inspired simply by my mother’s gingerbread cookies and our dog who’d charge into the kitchen and gobble up anything we’d accidentally dropped.</p>
					<p class="other-text"> When my parents tell this story, they love to mention that they were expecting just to humor an excited first-grader for an hour, spending time as a family, before just moving on-- and that unexpectedly, they ended up having a great time playing! My dad states that later, I revealed to them that when I grew up I wanted to make games. He asked me why, and my answer to him was my mission statement (albeit from a first-grader’s vocabulary). Both my desire to make games and the reason for it have not changed in all those years; game design is my dream.</p>

            <h2 class="other-text">My Introduction to Programming</h2>
            <div class="row mt-4">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p class="other-text"> As luck would have it, I was given the option in grade 9 to take a mixed shop & tech class. I enjoyed the workshop half of the class but only with mild curiosity when compared to how much I enjoyed the tech half of it; we were taught my first ever programming language: <i>Object Oriented Turing</i> (OOT).</p>
                    <p class="other-text"> I hyper-fixated on OOT with a passion paralleling only my interests in both making and playing games. I quickly learned that I could make games using it, and the first “game” I ever made and programmed was a little Mario platformer with rigid physics that took place all on one screen-- everything was tiny, but I <i>loved</i> it.</p>
                    <p class="other-text"> In grade 10, I disassembled a simple side-scrolling space game that came with the OOT language disk. My best friend and I were so ahead of the class that the teacher let us do whatever we wanted, and so I delved through the source code in class, learned how they implemented side-scrolling, and put it to use in my new creation. It wasn’t perfect; the physics were still very rigid, and the graphics and sound effects were shamelessly grabbed from online. However, what I’d managed to create was a dirty replication of the first four levels of SMB1, side-scrolling included. My friends and I were ecstatic.</p>
                    <p class="other-text"> OOT became my focus for a long time. I was too far ahead of the class for the teacher to help, and I didn’t have another programming course for another 4-5 years, so all of my programming knowledge for years was self-taught. I would take apart more programs that came with the disk and I’d spend hours reading through the help manual to learn new functions. I made a great many games, many of which were never finished; I’d get bored and put most of them aside as soon as I learned <i>how</i> to make them. Some of the games, however, I put a little more work into. These were the games that followed my mission statement, rather than just being made as tools to help me learn more programming: <i>Platform Dance</i>, <i>Brick-a-Block</i> (in its earliest form), <i>Super Mario Bros Custom</i>, and a text-based adventure that eventually instead became a pen and paper adventure, marking my first steps into being a dungeon master (DM) for D&D games.</p>
